# Captcha Generator using Python

This project is a simple and effective CAPTCHA generator built using Python. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with the Tkinter module, making it easy to generate and display CAPTCHA images. The primary aim is to provide a straightforward tool for generating CAPTCHA challenges to enhance security on websites and applications..
## Learnings

- **Python Programming:** Strengthened my understanding of Python syntax, data structures, and object-oriented programming principles.

- **Tkinter GUI Development:** Learned how to design and implement graphical user interfaces using Tkinter, including creating windows, buttons, and image displays.

- **Image Processing:** Explored techniques for generating and manipulating images programmatically, particularly in the context of generating CAPTCHA challenges.

- **Algorithm Design:** Developed algorithms to generate random text, distort images, and apply noise to create secure and challenging CAPTCHA images.

- **Error Handling and Validation:** Implemented error handling techniques to ensure the application runs smoothly and can handle unexpected inputs gracefully.

- **Project Organization:** Improved skills in structuring a Python project, managing dependencies, and writing clear and concise code documentation.
